## Repository Overview

This is a simple static website repository for AI web page experiments. The repository contains:

- `index.html` - A basic HTML page with Visigothic theme

## Architecture

## Development

Since this is a static HTML site with no build tools or dependencies:

- No build commands are needed
- No package managers or dependencies to install
- No linting or testing framework is configured
- Changes can be made directly to `index.html`
- The site can be viewed by opening `index.html` in a web browser or serving it with any static file server
